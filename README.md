# GoCodingProblems

## Acknowledgements

* This repository is inspired by [@mission-peace](https://github.com/mission-peace). Much credit to him in helping me understand the algorithms and approaches to nearly all of these problems. In many cases, these are Go implementations of his Java solutions. I would highly encourage you to check out his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZLJf_R2sWyUtXSKiKlyvAw), [GitHub](https://github.com/mission-peace/interview), and/or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tusharroy25).
